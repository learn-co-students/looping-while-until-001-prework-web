# Let's get the second test passing by coding our solution in until.rb:
# Fill out the content of the using_until method to puts the desired phrase,
#  "Wingardium Leviosa", until our levitation force equals 10. Remember, 
#  every time you puts the phrase, you should increment your levitation 
#  force by 1.
